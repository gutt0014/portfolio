# Portfolio README
This repository contains the code for my personal web portfolio.

## About
My portfolio showcases my skills and projects as a designer and developer. It includes sections for home, about me, resume, my work, and contact.

## Process

### Development
I used the hi-fi portfolio website created in User Experience Design. I then started to develop the site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework for responsiveness and styling. I incorporated various Bootstrap components such as navbar, cards, forms, and buttons to enhance the user experience.

### Challenges Faced

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website looked good on all devices was challenging, especially managing different screen sizes and orientations.
2. **Integration of Bootstrap**: Although Bootstrap provided many pre-styled components, customizing them to fit the design requirements was sometimes tricky.


### Overcoming Challenges

1. **Columns**: I used columns in bootstrap to align the layouts just right for each screen size. 
2. **Custom CSS**: Writing custom CSS rules alongside Bootstrap classes allowed me to fine-tune the styles and achieve the desired look.


## Lessons Learned

- **Responsive Design**: I gained a deeper understanding of responsive web design principles and techniques.
- **Bootstrap**: Working with Bootstrap improved my proficiency in using front-end frameworks to expedite development and ensure consistency.
